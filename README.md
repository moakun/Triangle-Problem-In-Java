# Triangle-Problem-In-Java

Design and develop a program in a language of your choice to solve the triangle problem defined as follows: Accept three integers which are supposed to be the three sides of a triangle and determine if the three values represent an equilateral triangle, isosceles triangle, scalene triangle, or they do not form a triangle at all. Assume that the upper limit for the size of any side is 200. Derive test cases for your program based on boundary value analysis, execute the test cases and discuss the results.

It receive three integers a, b, c as input. If a, b, c satisfy these conditions below:
    C1.    1≤a ≤200                  C4.    a < b + c
    C2.    1≤b ≤200                  C5.    b < a + c
    C3.    1≤c ≤200                  C6.    c < a + b
Four possible outputs: 
Not a Triangle
Scalene
Isosceles
Equilateral
